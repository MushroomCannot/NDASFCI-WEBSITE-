       The following year, the name of the school was changed to Notre Dame College until the College Department was phased out in 1952. 
       The High School Department continued up to the present carrying the new name of Notre Dame Academy. 
       Fr. Camomot was succeeded by Juan Boltron, then by Fr. Jose Motus, and then by Fr. Jorge Kintanar.

       The last Parish Priest Director of Notre Dame Academy was Fr. Constantino Batoctoy.  He was responsible for the construction 
       of the present high school building, with the support of the late Julio Cardinal Rosales, one of the proprietors of the school.
       In school year 1969-70, Cardinal Julio Rosales installed Sr. Lilia Hilarion, a ICM nun, as the first Directress and Principal of 
        Notre Dame Academy.
